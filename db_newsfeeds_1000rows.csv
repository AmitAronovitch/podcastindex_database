Before all of the blockbuster film franchises and the non-stop spoiler-filled internet coverage there was limited space to openly discuss such topics let alone their proper pronunciations. (""Is it Mag-neato or Mag-net-o?"") So with that in mind, what started as a long-running, inside joke has now become a word that best defines the spirit of this podcast—looking at comic books, sci-fi, film, television, music, literature and gaming from the perspective of individuals who have grown up in this evolving ""nerd culture"" and are amazed by the ways in which it has taken over the mainstream. Galaktacus attempts to eschew that ""angry nerd"" character and celebrate the good, the bad and the weird that comes along with this current golden age of pop culture.

The photography centric podcast is hosted by veteran photojournalist Todd Mizener with help from fellow photogs Todd Welvaert and Meg McLaughlin. Our goal is to both entertain and inform with our personal experiences or via interviews with a wide variety of guests. Mizener is the former Director of Photography for the Dispatch/Argus, a mid-sized daily newspaper, located in western Illinois along the banks of the Mississippi River in Moline, Ill.  He is currently the Marketing & Communications Director for the D/A and Quad-City Times. We all get asked questions about our jobs and the podcast lets us answer some of those questions. It also affords us the opportunity to connect with readers, aspiring photographers, and learn a thing or two from our guests. The podcast is also an extension of our historically strong intern teaching program.

and welcome to the StarryTelling Podcast
with your host and celestial navigator
Gemini Brett of More Than Astrology.
Here, the myths and legends of old
will be used as fuel 
to launch the rocket ship
of our consciousness
into the Cosmos.
***********
We will begin by honoring 
the ancient traditions of spoken transmission 
by listening to an old starry story told anew.
Then we will set the controls to treasure hunt   
as, together, we seek to unravel the hidden gems of
Cosmological, 
Astronomical, 
Philosophical, 
Astrological, and 
Mystical
Wisdom
wrapped within these wispy webs of words.
***********
All aboard!
It’s time for lift off
so strap yourself in
and let us begin!

This church is not in any way, nor in any stretch of one's imagination, to be allowed to become a secular social station rather than a soul-saving station.  The ideas, concepts and principles that govern secular organizations are not always the best for directing the accomplishment of the church's mission. For it is God's intent for the church to set the pace for the world rather than have the world set the pace for the church.  This church, not being governed by the ways of the world, is a God worshiping church, a learning church, a soul-winning church and an every member tither church.  WORSHIPING - Every member seeking fellowship with God in spirit and in the truth by way of praying and praising.  LEARNING - Every member committed to studying God's word in Bible Study and Church Sunday School.  SOUL-WINNING - Each member is to show his Christian duty by applying the EACH ONE REACH ONE principle. Each member is to show his love for God by touching the untouched and reaching the unreachable.  TITHING MEMBER - God's way of financing the work of his kingdom is through tithes. Every member is to work to become a ten percent tither.","Antioch Varina","media@antiochvarina.org","Antioch Varina","https://rss.whooshkaa.com/rss/podcast/id/7252","0","https://files.whooshkaa.com/podcasts/podcast_7252/podcast_media/cf0194-antiochvarina-podcast.PNG","episodic","0",NULL,"0","1599774527","0","0","1585500000","0","0",,

Using their expertise in beer and music, these three lifelong friends Jay Rose, Rob Forczek, & James “Richard” Rabic bring brewers and beers to every episode, while providing insider knowledge on the exploding craft beer industry. The podcast is a part of the Osiris Media Network which is a national network that partners with JamBase.com. The show works because Richard is a beer novice while Jay Rose and Rob have seen the craft beer business grow up and become what it is today. They approach the show in the same way they would approach improvising on stage as musicians; not much planning and minimal actual “show prep.” It’s a free-wheeling conversation about beer, the business of beer, and the parallels between the beer business and the music business.

Step one.

Rethink Motivation dives into how successful entrepreneurs like Chris Brogan, Neil Patel, and Bob Burg were able to push through the obstacles, hardships, and setbacks of creating a business and life that matters. We dive into how they overcame fears and doubts, what gets them out of bed each morning, habits and routines that they can't live without, and more.

Think of it as weekly mentorship with your favorite business role-models.

Dr. Morris has been practicing internal medicine for more than 20 years, he went to Medical School at Johns Hopkins, trained at Yale, and previously held a teaching position at Harvard Medical School. He currently practices medicine and holds a teaching appointment at UCLA Medical School in Los Angeles where he teaches these habits to medical students, housestaff, doctors, and to his patients.

◉ Resident @: LET - Les Enfants Terribles | Digital Night Music

On my journey in waves since early 90s. DJing since 1996. In love with real technoid, deep, groovy, dubby, propelling, spherical and melodic elements... and of course deliciously clear sound!

""I wish everyone that you'll find your very own source of fulfillment; for me it is music - could it be the same to you?
Well, find out: LISTEN!""

The purpose of our Wisdom-Trek podcast and journal is to teach you wisdom and discipline, to help you understand the insights of the wise, to teach you to live disciplined and successful lives,  to help you do what is right, just, and fair.

Wisdom-Trek.com is your portal to all things pertaining to the acquisition of wisdom, insight, and knowledge.  The Wisdom-Trek platform includes this website along with a daily journal, and a daily podcast on wisdom and creating a living legacy.  It is your portal because it is our hope that everyone will share and participate in gaining wisdom, insight, and discernment.

We want to provide the pool service industry with a set of ideas, principles, and techniques to help you run a more successful business, take care of your pools more quickly, and make more money – in other words, we’ve developed a new approach to your pools, your customers, and your work.

 We were not satisfied with the way our businesses were going, so we used our life and business experiences to analyze our residential pool service business. As a result of this we believe that we’ve developed a better way to run your business.  We’ve tried these ideas and principles and they have worked for us so we know they will work for you.

If it sounds like we are not fitness cover models… that’s cause we are not. We are regular people just like you, also endowed with stubborn body types, anxieties, and frustrations. After struggling through everything that works and what doesn’t, we have finally found balance, confidence, and consistent self appreciation. We feel life is too short not to share the journey and enable you to experience the same.

Let us empower you to finally make the changes to your life you have been promising yourself.

Featuring uniquely local voices from towns and big cities across each province and territory, each postcard will reveal a telling tale about Canada’s disappearing downtown culture.

Compositor y destacado exponente del romanticismo italiano. En 1939 estrenó la primera obra que le dio éxito “Oberto, conde de San Bonifacio”. Tiempo después, óperas como “Nabucco” (1842), “Rigoletto” (1851) y “La Traviata” (1853), lo consagraron como el máximo compositor de ópera del siglo XIX.  Otras creaciones de Verdi como “Macbeth” (1847), “Aida” (1871) y “Otello” (1887) son algunos ejemplos que siguen deleitando al público en teatros alrededor del mundo.
		El estreno de “Misa de Réquiem”, obra que se reproduce a continuación, se llevó a cabo en 1874 en la iglesia de San Marcos en Milán. Juan Arturo Brennan comenta que Verdi la compuso en homenaje póstumo al poeta y filósofo Alessandro Manzoni, por quien sentía profunda admiración. Para su elaboración, Verdi utilizó el manuscrito que había preparado tiempo antes para su colaboración en la composición de un Réquiem colectivo en memoria de Gioachino Rossini. Asimismo, Brennan destaca el Dies irae, el segundo movimiento, “por su imaginería sonora potentísima y por momentos espeluznante en la que el creador de óperas brilla en todo su esplendor dramático”. El pianista y director de orquesta Hans von Bülow calificó esta creación de Verdi como “una ópera con ropaje sacro”.
		Este concierto fue interpretado por la Orquesta Filarmónica de la UNAM y se grabó en vivo en la Sala Nezahualcóyotl del Centro Cultural Universitario. Contó con la dirección artística de Jan Latham-Koenig y la participación de la soprano Jessica Muirhead, la mezzosoprano Anastasia Bibicheva, el tenor Georgy Vasiliev y el bajo de Evgeny Stavinsky.

Actualmente alterna su trabajo como escritor con la traducción de textos y la escritura de guiones para televisión. Entre otros libros, es autor de ‘Crecer es un oficio triste’, ‘Abril rojo’, ‘Jet Lag’, ‘Memorias de una dama’, ‘Tan cerca de la vida’ y ‘Sam no es mi tío’. En 2006, obtuvo el Premio Alfaguara de Novela, que lo catapultó al mercado literario iberoamericano.
		A continuación reproducimos el capítulo inicial de la novela ‘Pudor’, la cual narra la vida íntima de cada uno de los miembros de una familia, hecho que incluye todos aquellos secretos que deberían salir a la luz pero que, de hacerlo, causarían un absoluto desastre. 
		En este fragmento se expone el caso del más pequeño del árbol genealógico: un niño de ocho años quien avizora una presencia fantasmal, momentos antes del fallecimiento de su abuela.
		Agradecemos a editorial Santillana su autorización para hacer la comunicación pública de este material, así como la colaboración musical de Andrew Fridman.

Too many women are trapped by the use of shopping to manufacture happiness, define their worth, recapture missed childhood opportunities, or impress other people, resulting in a mountain of debt and a loss of their identities. Our financial empowerment movement liberates women from the need to seek validation from others and material possessions and living life based on other people’s opinions, allowing them to graduate from paycheck-to-paycheck and inauthentic living into a life of financial freedom, purpose, and abundance.  In this podcast, FNPhenomenal Founder, Aisha Taylor, interviews a FNPhenomenal Women who shares her story about overcoming fear to living a phenomenal life defined on her own terms and the freedom and abundance that came with that decision.  If you are struggling with fear, feelings of inadequacy, stress, lack of purpose, and are searching for the true freedom to live your phenomenal life then this is the podcast for you.  Aisha Taylor will show you what it means to live phenomenally by living more, spending less, and becoming financially phenomenal.

Nate receives a draft notice from the Army but after some “encouragement” from his mother, decides to enlist in the Air Force instead. It is 1965. Nate is 20 years old. Airman Flowers goes not to Vietnam but Germany, straight into a military Catch-22. His assignment: writing stories as a reporter for the Stars and Stripes newspaper which will never see print. Nate's adventure deepens as he and his fellow troops try to understand why they're there, the military mindset, and the massive social turbulence of 1960s America. Existential, psychedelic, funny, and laced with rock 'n' roll, Wild Blue Yonder is the story of Nate's quest for personal and spiritual values while discovering the meaning of family, friendship, and the love of the girl he left behind.

""I could not put this novel down, and I did not want the journey to end. This is a well-written, engaging, very funny, thoughtful and bold first novel for this author.” - Rita Peterson

“A coming-of-age story set in the 1960's, Wild Blue Yonder offers what finding yourself really means set against the turmoil of a time, place, and culture so different and similar to today. I heartily recommend this book!” - Casie

“Overall, a great read, highly recommended.” - Michael Fedison","Jack B. Rochester on Podiobooks.com",,,,"0","http://static.libsyn.com/p/assets/5/f/d/f/5fdfc1f2a91bbd1d/PB-WBY-Cover1200.jpg","episodic","0","Libsyn WebEngine 2.0","0","1600215607","0","0","1432590550","0","0","en",

*** Each nugget covers one topic that is 5 - 10 minutes in length

*** No complex theological teachings - just practical,  easy-to-understand Bible truths that can change your life and help you make a difference in the lives of those around you 

*** My heart is to teach the Millennial Generation that life will never be boring when you learn to hear the Holy Spirit, walk in obedience to what He says, and allow God to use you however He desires. God wants to use you to make a real difference for Him in an uncertain world.

If you've ever wondered just what has been happening in the Middle East for the last few years, this is the podcast for you. So, how are we going to do this? We're going to tell the story of the Middle East since 1900, and take it up to the present day. We'll look at a mixture of revolutions, social reform, political developments, global diplomacy and economic boom and bust across the region that attracts so much attention from the rest of the world. From Turkey to Egypt, Dubai to Syria, Iran to Israel, Afghanistan to Tunisia, we'll follow how the world of 1900 became the world we live in today.","Jamie Redfern","thehistoryofpodcast@gmail.com","Jamie Redfern",,"0","http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bagQIftoUck/VXM7lIrptiI/AAAAAAAAAEI/dARFGg9JiXQ/s1600/Arab%2BSpring%2BLogo.jpg",NULL,"0",NULL,"0","1599358879","0","0","1539450900","0","0",,

Great question! One of my lifelong passions has been studying the martial arts. And the place where you study and train in martial arts is a Dojo. 

Christian Discipleship is similar to martial arts training (if you don’t believe me, just ask Paul–he says so himself in his letter to Christians in ancient Corinth [1Cor. 9:26-27]!). We have a Sensei (teacher): Jesus. We have a katana (sword): Scripture. 

Thus Disciple Dojo is intended as a virtual Dojo–where students of the Master can be sharpened, challenged, equipped and encouraged as they continue to become more and more like the One they serve…minus the scrapes and bruises!","JM Smith","discipledojo@gmail.com","DiscipleDojo",,"0","http://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000380200571-psq4dp-original.jpg",NULL,"0",NULL,"0","1600105605","0","0","1599595291","0","0","en",

Puerto Patida ist Spielshow, Hörspiel und Rollenspiel in einem. In jeder Folge wird eine Person auf der Insel Puerto Patida angeschwemmt und muss Rätsel lösen, um zu überleben und selbst Bürgerin oder Bürger auf dem Eiland zu werden. Erlebe mit, wie Kandidatinnen und Kandidaten um ihr Leben rätseln, vor Kannibalen fliehen und der Insel ihren eigenen Stempel aufdrücken! ""Das Monkey Island der Podcasts"".

Löse oder Fritteuse!

Dabei trifft sie auf ehemalige KandidatInnen („Bürger“) und zahlreiche kuriose Charaktere, wie einen Kneipenbesitzer, der wie Helmut Kohl klingt, einen Magier, der eigentlich gar nicht zaubern kann oder den Gourmet-Kannibalen, der nur angeschwemmte Personen – also Kandidaten – jagt und verspeist, die die Rätsel nicht schnell genug lösen. Fast so wie in „Point ’n Click-Adventures“ wie „Monkey Island“.
Puerto Patida ist in Staffeln aufgeteilt. Die erste Staffel bestand aus 21 Folgen, inklusive mehreren Bühnen-Auftritten auf dem Podstock, dem Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg und dem Podcamp 2016 in Essen.
Für Staffel 2 wurden wir unter anderem von TV-Autoren gecoached, um noch bessere Geschichten zu erzählen und das Format weiter auszubauen. Unsere Hörer fühlen sich uns sehr verbunden, sie zeichnen für uns Fanart, raten mit und kommentieren fleißig. Sie besteht aus 14 Folgen.
Über 50 Personen sind bereits an Puerto Patida beteiligt gewesen. 

Dafür vielen Dank!

Szakértő vendégeink segítségével igyekszünk tanácsokat adni fiatal felnőtteknek, illetve negyvenes, ötvenes éveikben járó szülőknek. Beszélgetéseink kapcsán a szülők elgondolkodnak saját családi kapcsolataikon, a családon belül lezajló konfliktusos helyzeteken, amelyekre megoldásmintákat kínálunk.

I believe the lord has called me to build a strong community of men. The mission of this community is to allow men to learn from one another's successes and failures in marriage and parenting. The True Family Men Podcast was born to give men a platform to share their testimonies of how Jesus Christ has brought them out of life greatest challenges and how to begin the healing process. We as men face many problems in life from lust, pornography addiction, drug and alcohol addiction, anger, stress, false sense of manliness, the list is endless, but through a strong community of believers and the redeeming power of christ's blood we can overcome! 
 I enjoy camping, eagle scouting, hiking, and the  weekly chic-fila splurges! I personally enjoy reading, weight lifting, and connecting with new men across the world who have a love for Jesus Christ.

I believe that God has called us family men to be the spiritual leaders of our homes. It's time to rise up and show our community, friends, co-workers, and family members what a true Godly man looks like. Take a stand brothers and help me build this community of men who are helping each other grow mentally, physically and spiritually to better lead their families!","David Johnson","truefamilymen@gmail.com","David Johnson","https://feeds.captivate.fm/truthreconstructed/","0","https://artwork.captivate.fm/1d4023ef-7354-43d4-baee-805a5b2d1434/podcast-artwork-1400x1400.jpg","episodic","0","Captivate.fm","0","1599359032","0","0","1585395900","0","0",,

Er stellt ihnen besondere Menschen vor, die wirklich etwas zu sagen haben. Er möchte sie an außergewöhnlichen Leistungen, bewegenden Momenten und mutigen Entscheidungen teilhaben lassen. Oder anders gesagt: Er will sie unterhalten, verblüffen, begeistern, berühren, inspirieren, Ihnen neue Sichtweisen eröffnen, neue Impulse und neue Denkanstöße liefern – und das mit jeder einzelnen Podcast-Folge! Hier werden wöchentlich spannende Persönlichkeiten interviewt, die sich weit weg vom  Mainstream bewegen, also wirkliche Typen, die mit Ecken und Kanten, aber auch mit Höhen und Tiefen „ihr Ding“ gemacht haben bzw. immer noch machen.  Im Mittelpunkt dieser Interviews werden dabei Fragen zu Themen, wie z.B. Life Stories, Fußball/ Sport, internationale Begegnungen und Life Balance stehen. Es erwartet Sie hier eine Vielzahl von tiefgängigen Fragestellungen zu besonderen Lebenssituationen und Lebensereignissen, die – nach dem Motto „Zuhören – Filtern – Adaptieren“ − zur Selbstreflexion einladen, neben dem Teilen schöner und spezieller Momente mit diesen besonderen Menschen.",,,,,"0","https://go4qualitytime.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/160306_Artwork-%C3%BCberarbeitet446x444.jpg","episodic","0","Podlove Podcast Publisher v2.9.6","0","1600216258","0","0","1570957238","0","0","de-DE",

It is intended for both first-time students and those wishing to brush up on their algebra skills.
This is one of my favorite courses to teach because this is where your foundation in algebra begins and I'd like to help build or repair your foundation.

This course, taught on campus twice per week for 75 minutes each, was primarily recorded at the Lancaster Campus of Harrisburg Area Community College. The video recordings are predominantly unedited clips from live classes.

There is no prerequisite for this course. 

For the most part all calculations in this course are done without the use of a calculator; however there will be times when I require the use of a basic scientific calculator (not a graphing calculator).","Susan Cooper-Nguyen",,,,"0","https://itunesu-assets.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/CobaltPublic7/v4/f5/6f/fa/f56ffa1e-3b09-5ee6-be2a-eec454773132/mza_234978983037064620.jpg",NULL,"0",NULL,"0","1599358880","0","0","1468528740","0","0",,

McCall World War II Oral History Project has shifted its focus from the war abroad to the war at home. Sixteen Washington College students, led by oral history instructors from the C. V. Starr Center for the Study of the American Experience at Washington College, spent six weeks learning the process of conducting research and interviewing residents of Chestertown and the surrounding area, while building an oral history archive and preparing a gallery exhibition in honor of the contributions made by Kent County community members at home and abroad during World War II. 

This project provides students with an amazing learning experience, and the Chestertown community with an invaluable resource of community history. By interviewing anyone who has memories of what Chestertown (and its surrounding area of Kent and Queen Anne's Counties) was like during the war--memories about rationing, plane-spotting, taking up war work, joining the militia, participating in blood and bond drives--the StoryQuest team hopes to create a first-rate educational resource and to strengthen the bonds of community, past and present, young and old.","CV Starr Center at Washington College",,,,"0","https://itunesu-assets.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/CobaltPublic7/v4/55/0e/6f/550e6f9e-e4dc-0623-8a95-9507ec93a629/mza_5765810313345402452.jpg",NULL,"0",NULL,"0","1599358880","0","0","1437078060","0","0",,

Dear Canada is an audio postcard series that follows the journey of The Tale of a Town’s storymobile as it crosses the country to capture the collective community memory of our main streets, one story at a time, leading up to Canada’s 150th anniversary in 2017.

Featuring uniquely local voices from towns and big cities across each province and territory, each postcard will reveal a telling tale about Canada’s disappearing downtown culture.  Hosts Charles Ketchabaw and Lisa Marie DiLiberto mix the most compelling interviews gathered as part of their national oral history project with inquisitive commentary addressed to listeners across the country.

AWDMS:
A Walk Down Main Street is a  long form podcast series that takes a deeper look at the characters and tales at the heart of Ontario’s downtown neighbourhoods.

Hosted by Darkroom Productions' Andrew Ibrado and StellarJay Records/Publishing's John Quinonez. One Last Thing brings together active ""makers"" in the community (musicians, poets, chefs, business owners) to talk of their work and inspirations in light-hearted open forum discussion. 

Guests randomly draw from and respectively add to an ever-growing pool of questions. Everything from the introspective to absurd, as part of spontaneous ice breaker project.

FORTUNE 421  |  A.W.O.L (Another Way of Life)

Mitchell Porter, commonly known as PORTERHAUS, is a San Diego (USA) based DJ and aspiring producer. Mitchell has a deep and complex connection with music that started at a very young age. Originally, a drummer since the age of 10, he became entranced with electronic music in the early 2000’s and hasn’t looked back. Mitchell shares no greater joy than being able to express himself through music. 

Over the last few years, Mitchell has transitioned from being a ""Bedroom DJ” to receiving regular bookings in Southern California and beyond. His style touches every aspect of house music ranging from deep, tech, and progressive sounds. There truly is a bright future ahead for PORTERHAUS as he continues to hone his DJ craft and begin the exciting journey of music production.","PORTERHAUS","contact@porterhausmusic.com","PORTERHAUS",,"0","http://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000201506880-yb6n83-original.jpg",NULL,"0",NULL,"0","1599763281","0","0","1473440802","0","0",,

In many cases, they become self-described ""starving artists"".   

This podcast aims to end the vicious cycle by helping emerging talent learn from veterans in the field. Through live interviews with experienced artists, Jess Kaswiner asks questions about how these artists got their start, and what advice they have for young artists on the 'come up'. 

This bi-monthly podcast, offers timely, relevant advice to artist entrepreneurs across disciplines, demographics, and geographic locations.  As Eric Booth states in 20UNDER40, ""We are all emerging leaders, regardless of chronology. The pace of change in our culture and the stuckness of our field demand a new kind of leadership to accomplish the change required by our times.""

It’s a no-cost, all-welcome motoring show where the visitors and their machines are the stars. There’s no driving – apart from what we hope will be a delightful early-morning run to the circuit on some of Sussex’s finest roads.
Each Breakfast Club has a unique theme, ranging from supercars to soft-tops to pre-1966 cars. New for 2014 is Vee-Power Sunday, a celebration of everything on two and four wheels powered by a vee-engine. It doesn’t matter if bringing a special car to show or just coming along for a look, the spectacle is just as awesome.

And of course the morning wouldn’t be complete without a hearty organic Goodwood breakfast. That’s one of the options in a range of catering facilities available. Depending on weather, other attractions may include flying displays and (at extra cost) karting and Goodwood’s drift experience.

Now in its ninth year, the Goodwood Breakfast Club is firmly established as a ‘must attend’ event for thousands of car and motorcycle connoisseurs. No wonder it’s known as the petrol-head’s perfect Sunday – and one of the country’s best free days out.","CRE8MEDIA LTD","matt@cre8media.net","Matt Jones",,"0","http://cre8media.net/podcastfeeds/breakfastclub2015.jpg",NULL,"0","Feeder 2.5.12(2294); Mac OS X Version 10.10.5 (Build 14F27) http://reinventedsoftware.com/feeder/","0","1599763281","0","0","1441798263","0","0",,

Who better to ""roast"" it, than us?
Listen in as we take a satirical off beat look at Star Trek through good-natured razzing and parody the ins and outs that make this franchise great. 

Trek Yourself (before you wreck yourself) Podcast is a recorded show dedicated to all things Star Trek.  It is not an episode review show.  Think of it as a combination of breakdown and analysis with a large splash of improv comedy and a side of reality show. 

Starting with a basis in Star Trek and adding other pop culture elements, this podcast informs, entertains and inspires. 
Well, probably not inspires, but hopefully entertains.

Moreno de Alba dedicaron sus trabajos y sus días al conocimiento humanístico. Judío escapado de su país natal durante la época nazi, refugiado en el México de Lázaro Cárdenas, Katz —como explica en un ensayo Adolfo Gilly— entregó obras sólidas por su investigación y aportaciones como ‘La guerra secreta en México’ y  Pancho Villa’. El genio y figura de Moreno de Alba, por su parte, incluyeron una reiterada y fértil dedicación al estudio del español mexicano, como señala Concepción Company Company y como el propio filólogo, autor de las famosas ‘Minucias del lenguaje’, explica en una entrevista que en 2006 concedió a Adolfo Castañón y que rescatamos para esta edición. Dos episodios paradigmáticos de la cultura y la historia mexicana son tratados por Sara Poot Herrera y Humberto Musacchio en las siguientes páginas: en el primer caso, se relata la infeliz y apasionada historia de amor del político revolucionario Felipe Carrillo Puerto y la periodista estadounidense Alma Reed y, en el segundo, la exposición de arte abstracto de Los Cuatro Azules —entre los que figuraban Kandinsky y Klee— en 1931 en la Ciudad de México, que tuvo una idiosincrásica respuesta de un buen sector de la prensa nacional. Dos revolucionarios del siglo XX europeo, uno en la literatura de ficción y el otro en el pensamiento filosófico, dejaron una herencia trascendental a la cultura de Occidente. Hace cien años, en 1914, el autor irlandés James Joyce pudo ver finalmente publicado su revolucionario volumen de relatos ‘Dublineses’, luego de innumerables dificultades, como explica Hernán Lara Zavala. Por su parte, Michel Foucault, de cuya muerte se cumplen tres décadas, trastocó nociones heredadas con sus disecciones de distintos campos de la vida humana, como fue el caso del derecho penal con su libro ‘Vigilar y castigar’. Este es el tema de un erudito texto de Ignacio Carrillo Prieto. Nuestro número presenta de igual modo ensayos sobre José Revueltas, Mónica Lavín, Emmanuel Carballo, José de la Colina, Gonzalo Celorio y Mónica Lavín, cinco nombres destacados de la literatura mexicana cuyos títulos han dado forma a la nómina de obras valiosas en los territorios de la crítica, el ensayo, la novela y el cuento. Diversos aspectos de su vida y obra son tratados por Eloy Urroz, Vicente Leñero, Silvia Molina, Rosa Beltrán y Anamari Gomís. Incluimos, de igual modo, un emotivo texto de corte autobiográfico del doctor Juan Ramón de la Fuente. El reportaje gráfico está dedicado a la obra pictórica del también novelista y cuentista Guillermo Arreola (Tijuana, 1969), quien ha realizado 20 exposiciones individuales con notable éxito crítico, aquí en diálogo creativo con la poeta Pura López Colomé, la autora de Santo y seña, galardonada con el Premio Xavier Villaurrutia.

From illustrated children’s books to Thomas Hardy, from Star Wars to Middlemarch, we find out what fiction has meant to each of the scientists and peek inside the covers of the books that have played a major role in their lives. ‘Novel Thoughts’ was inspired by research at St Andrew’s University by Dr Sarah Dillon (now a lecturer in the Faculty of English at Cambridge) who interviewed 20 scientists for the ‘What Scientists Read’ project. She found that reading fiction can help scientists to see the bigger picture and be reminded of the complex richness of human experience. Novels can show the real stories behind the science, or trigger a desire in a young reader to change lives through scientific discovery. They can open up new worlds, or encourage a different approach to familiar tasks.","Cambridge University","ns480@cam.ac.uk","Nick Saffell",,"0","http://rss.sms.cam.ac.uk/itunes-image/1998097.jpg",NULL,"0",NULL,"0","1599763210","0","0","1433328168","0","0",,
